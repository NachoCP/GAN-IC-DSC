# MNIST

First of all you need to donwload the mnist data from this URL http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ , and put it under a directory called "data". You can change the directory in the load data section that is inside the train.py

There are two differents ways of execute this GAN:

* IPython notebook, if you want to use this version you have it installed.
* Commands, using this form you need to have created a directory in the same path called "image". These image are going to be created during the training, showing the results of the training.
```console
python train.py
```
